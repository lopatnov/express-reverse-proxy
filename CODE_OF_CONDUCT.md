# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to make participation in our community a welcoming and respectful experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors that strengthen our community:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community, not just the individual

**Behaviors that are not acceptable:**

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information (such as address or email) without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They will take fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other official channels. It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at **oleksandr@lopatnov.cv.ua**. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.
