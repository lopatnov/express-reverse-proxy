## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/lopatnov/express-reverse-proxy/security/advisories/new) to report a vulnerability privately. Describe the issue in as much detail as possible:

- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

Once submitted, you will receive a response within a few business days. If the vulnerability is confirmed, a fix will be released and you will be credited in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

For general bugs that are not security-sensitive, please [open a regular issue](https://github.com/lopatnov/express-reverse-proxy/issues).
