## Run Server

> npm start

The server is listening on <http://localhost:8080>

## Docker support

```
> docker build -t lopatnov/server .
> docker run -p 8080:8080 lopatnov/server
```

## Configuration

Edit `server-config.json` file

### Configure server port

```json
{
  "port": 8080
  ...
}
```

To configure server port, edit `port` variable. The default server port is `8080`.

### Configure `folders` variable

The `folders` is a variable to serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

#### Serve static files from a single directory

```json
{
  "folders": "www"
}
```

This configuration means that the server will serve static files from a local `www` directory. The `folders` variable can changed by a value of relative path like "./www", "../../my-nice-project/www" or "./project/my-front-end-files".

#### Serve static files from multiple directories

```json
{
  "folders": ["./www", "./mock-json", "../../images"]
}
```

This configuration means that the server will serve static files from multiple directories:

- `./www`
- `./mock-json`
- `../../images`

#### Map url path to serve static files from directories

```json
{
  "folders": {
    "/": "dist",
    "/api": "./mock-json",
    "/assets": {
      "/images": "./images",
      "/css": "./scss/dist",
      "/script": "./scripts"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration means that the server will serve static files from multiple directories. The url path maps to this directories.

In example above you can see the next mapping:

```txt
url: /
directory: dist

url: /api
directory: ./mock-json

url: /assets/images
directory: ./images

url: /assets/css
directory: ./scss/dist

url: /assets/script
directory: ./scripts
```

### Configure `proxy` variable

The `proxy` variable intended for request redirect to 3rd-party server and getting result of this response.

#### Connect API to front-end project

```json
{
  "port": 4200,
  "folders": "www",
  "proxy": {
    "/api": "localhost:8000"
  }
}
```

This configuration means that the server will serve static files from a local `www` directory on 4200 port with remote API on <http://localhost:8000>. When the web-site makes request to "/api" path, the request will redirect to remote server with <localhost:8000> address.
